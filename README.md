# SK Config

A C++ header only library with configuration headers inspired heavily by Boost::Config but lighter for my own purposes.

You may use this header library by including it as a dependency to another CPak project and listing it as an interface towards the build target it should be included in. If you wish to use it standalone, can simply copy the files to your project. I do not have plans to support CMAKE after my build tool is completed.
