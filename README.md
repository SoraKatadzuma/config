# SK Config

A C++ header only library with configuration headers inspired heavily by Boost::Config but lighter for my own purposes.
It is managed by my own build tool which is under active development, which you can find [here](https://github.com/SoraKatadzuma/CPak/tree/refactoring). The `refactoring` branch is my primary dev branch, it will probably be renamed to trunk in the future while I develop it and tag versions onto main.
